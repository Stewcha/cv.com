      <h2>Experiance</h2>

      <p><strong><a href="#">Fullstack Web Developer, Lead Developer</a></strong><br>
      <b>Crystal Clear 3D Company</b> <br> 2013-present</p>
<p>
Since I started working at this company, I've been striving to improve the
entire system of how the company operates, speed up project completion, and
make work easier for my colleagues and myself. Over the years, I have created
numerous systems and scripts, as well as CMS platforms that daily facilitate
and accelerate work for both me and other employees. One could say these
are systems for automating and managing files and data, as the company
processes and utilizes a substantial volume of various files and information on
a daily basis.<br>
For many years, I have been maintaining the web server, website, and the
entire database we use. I created and organized the user interface to make it
easier for our clients, who use our systems every day. Additionally, I
successfully handled technical tasks related to processing and preparing files
in Photoshop. By creating Photoshop scripts, Windows scripts, and server
scripts, I accelerated tasks that would otherwise take weeks to complete in a
single day. Moreover, I made it possible for tasks that would typically require
multiple people to be performed by a single employee.<br>
I enjoy challenges, and in my current job, I have successfully solved many
problems we encountered. I also ensure that I fulfill every client's request
successfully. As the lead programmer in the company, I make an effort to
organize the project and determine how specific scripts and tasks should be
written, as well as to confirm that they work flawlessly, ensuring that the client
receives a perfect product. My job also involves debugging, optimization,
testing new things, and improving all existing elements that we use. I mentor
younger colleagues, oversee tasks, and make decisions.

   <h2>More About Me</h2>
   <p>I'm resourceful and full of ideas that I can't wait to implement in my projects. I
enjoy learning and testing new things, such as new frameworks, libraries, and
more, to see if they fit a particular project. I thrive on self improvement,
learning, and facing challenges in my work. Problem solving is something I
adore. I'm a team player and love working with people, sharing knowledge,
opinions, and receiving feedback and criticism. I approach projects with caution, considering
the entire situation and thinking about possible future scenarios before making
decisions. I excel at finding and fixing bugs and optimizing processes.
I wouldn’t call myself a perfect programmer, but I am highly skilled at improvising and solving problems effectively which helps me a lot with programming.

<br>
<b style="font-size:12px;">Why Im applying?</b>
